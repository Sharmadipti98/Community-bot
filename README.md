# Community Bot
## Overview
Welcome to the Community Bot repository! This bot automates the process of following back users who follow you and unfollowing those who unfollow you on GitHub.

## Key Features
### Automatic Follow Back: 
You can follow-back all the users automatically just by running the script followback.js! üòä
### Automatic Unfollow: 
Unfollow.js unfollows all the users automatically who don't follow you back. üòÅ
### Scheduled Runs: 
All the followers will get follow-back and non-reciprocal accounts will be unfollowed <strong>within an hour automatically<strong>.

## Important Notes 
### Respect:
The bot follows and unfollows based on a simple rule: if you follow me, I‚Äôll follow you back; if you unfollow me, I‚Äôll unfollow you. It‚Äôs all automated, so please be mindful of this automatic process.
### GitHub‚Äôs Rate Limits: 
Please note that GitHub has rate limits on API calls. The bot will respect these limits, but excessive use may temporarily block requests.
