# Community Bot
## Overview
Welcome to the Community Bot repository! This bot automates the process of following back users who follow you and unfollowing those who unfollow you on GitHub.

## Key Features

### Automatic Unfollow: 
You can unfollow users automatically who don't follow you back. üòÅ
### Scheduled Runs: 
The repository includes scheduling this automated behaviour on GitHub Actions

## Important Notes
### Respect: 
The bot follows and unfollows based on a simple rule: if you follow me, I‚Äôll follow you back; if you unfollow me, I‚Äôll unfollow you. It‚Äôs all automated, so please be mindful of this automatic process.
